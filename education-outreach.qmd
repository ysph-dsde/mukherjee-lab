## [Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data: A Summer Institute in Biostatistics (SIBS) Program](https://ysph.yale.edu/school-of-public-health/special-programs/big-data-summer-immersion-at-yale/)

The Big Data Summer Institute, a SIBS program, is an interdisciplinary training and research program in biostatistics that introduces undergraduate students to the intersection of big data and human health — a rapidly growing field that uses quantitative analysis to help solve scientific problems and improve people’s lives.

Drawing from the expertise and experience of outstanding faculty of several departments at the University of Michigan — biostatistics, statistics, and electrical engineering and computer science — the institute exposes undergraduate students to diverse experiences and techniques that distinguishes it from any other undergraduate summer program in biostatistics in the country.

This Summer Institute in Biostatistics (SIBS) program is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), grant R25HL147207, with the intent to introduce undergrad students to the field of biostatistics. Courses will include data collected in studies of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. To learn more about our sister programs, please visit the NHLBI SIBS program website.


## Workshops

Yale's Public Health Data Science and Data Equity (DSDE) team created a workshop series for Public Health and Biostatistics masters-level students at Yale. They are designed to help learners effectively leverage computational tools and analytical methods in their educational and professional endeavors. 

You can find out more about past and upcoming tutorials on our YouTube (coming soon) and [YSPH DSDE events page](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/research-centers-and-initiatives/public-health-data-science-and-data-equity/events/). The codespaces and slides associated with each workshop can be found in the [YSPH-DSDE GitHub](https://github.com/ysph-dsde) page.

If you have suggestions for workshops or other events, please reach out to us at admin.dsdeysph@yale.edu. If you are affiliated with Yale, you can set up an office hour appointment with one of the data scientists ([Workshop Bookings Page](https://outlook.office.com/book/DataScienceDataEquityOfficeHours@yale.edu/?ae=true&login_hint)).
